# Issues so far
### Wayland / Hyprland
- [ ] Cursor sometimes gets stuck with one "icon", like the text beam for example
- [ ] Sometime the mouse-based window movement and in-window mouse events break completely
- [ ] Mouse sometimes lags when moving between monitors

### Audio
- [ ] Audio sometimes stutters randomly
- [ ] No output on default HDMI profile. Workaround: Using the "Pro Audio" profile, but the audio quality is different.
- [ ] No audio sharing on Discord / Vesktop
